# code-refactor

**Refactoring** existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular homework assignment, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 

In this first assignment, I cleaned up the given index.html and the style.css files, getting rid of unnecessary div tags and using semantic HTML elements.

I put forth my best effort structuring the code in the index and the style sheet to look cleaner and consolidate the code to the best of my abilities, while keeping the same function for the webpage. 

Finally, I added descriptive title to my project and added alt tags to all images.
